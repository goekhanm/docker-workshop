# Motivation {bg=#000;assets/img/compose.jpeg}

# Pain Points
- Runtime environments are difficult to reproduce
- Software runtime dependencies
- Build tools are difficult to install
- Or require specific OS

# Why Containers?

- Containers are a standard format<br/>
- Easily portable across environment<br/>
- Packages up software binaries and dependencies<br/>
- Isolates software from each other<br/>
- Ecosystem has developed around containers<br/>

# Why should devs care? 1/3

- A fast, clean, safe, hygienic and portable runtime
- Ensures all team members are using exactly the same tools
- Ensures the build server is using exactly the same tools


# Why should devs care? 2/3

- No missing dependencies, packages and other pain points
- Own isolated container, various versions of libraries
- Automate testing, integration, packaging

# Why should devs care? 3/3

- Reduce concerns about compatibility on platforms
- Easy service deploymenty
- Allows local development
- It allows me to experiment with support technology without having pollute my development machine 

# Why should ops care? 1/2

- Make lifecycle more efficient, consistent and repeatable
- Increase the quality of code produced by devs
- Eliminate inconsistencies between dev, test, prod and customer environments

# Why should ops care? 2/2

- Support segregation of duties
- Significantly improve the speed and reliability of CI/CD
- Lightweight, address significant performance issues, deployment costs
